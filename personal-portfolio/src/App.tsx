            <p className="about-text"> My name is Andrew Fassler and I am a Software 
              Systems Undergraduate at Simon Fraser University with experience 
              in  C++, Java, HTML, and CSS. While most of my programming experience 
              is through school I am working toward building personal projects by 
              learning React and Tailwind. I am also trying to familiar with Github and 
              industry practices (through CMPT 276) to smoothly transition myself from 
              school to real-world development.

              <h3>League of Legends</h3>
              <p>Over the past year I have developed an 
                interest in watching professional League 
                of Legends like the LCK (League of Legends Championships 
                Korea). I enjoy analyzing team compositions 
                and playstyles especially. I'm excited for the second largest 
                annual event, MSI, that is coming to Vancouver this summer! </p>

              <h3>Exercise</h3>
              <p> I believe that everyone should have some kind of physical 
                hobby to take care of their physical health. For me, it is 
                working out and going on walks. Having a hobby that you enjoy 
                outside of computers is a good way to maintain balance.</p>

              <h3>Playing with Pet</h3>
              <p> I have an interest in fantasy settings, so I love books such 
                as The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion.  </p>

              <h3>Playing with Pet</h3>
              <p> I love playing with and taking care of my girlfriendâ€™s dog,
                Gohan! Gohan is an almost 3 year old maltipoo (maltese poodle) 
                and is very friendly and playful! </p>
