          <p className="about-text"> My name is Andrew Fassler and I am a Software 
            Systems Undergraduate at Simon Fraser University with experience 
            in  C++, Java, HTML, and CSS. While most of my programming experience 
            is through school I am working toward building personal projects by 
            learning React and Tailwind. I am also trying to familiar with Github and 
            industry practices (through CMPT 276) to smoothly transition myself from 
            school to real-world development.

            <h3>League of Legends</h3>
            <p>Over the past year I have developed an 
              interest in watching professional League 
              of Legends like the LCK (League of Legends Championships 
              Korea). I enjoy analyzing team compositions 
              and playstyles especially. I'm excited for the second largest 
              annual event, MSI, that is coming to Vancouver this summer! </p>

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p> I believe that everyone should have some kind of physical 
              hobby to take care of their physical health. For me, it is 
              working out and going on walks. Having a hobby that you enjoy 
              outside of computers is a good way to maintain balance.</p>

            <h3>Playing with Pet</h3>
            <p> I have an interest in fantasy settings, so I love books such 
              as The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion.  </p>

            <h3>Playing with Pet</h3>
            <p> I love playing with and taking care of my girlfriendâ€™s dog,
              Gohan! Gohan is an almost 3 year old maltipoo (maltese poodle) 
              and is very friendly and playful! </p>

              <h3> Office Assistant <br/> December 2021-August 2023</h3>
              <p>As an office assistant, I assisted the accountant  with ensuring 
                that employees were paid on time and with the correct hours. 
                I also developed organizational skills by filing receipts and paperwork 
                to maintain efficient documentation and ensure easy access to important 
                records.</p>

              <h3> Banquet Server<br/> January 2022-August 2022</h3>
              <p>I worked as a server at a banquet hall, helping with setting
                 up and breaking down events and serving dishes to guests. 
                 An important skill I managed to learn was to work in a 
                 fast-paced environment where I always needed to be finding 
                 something to do or someone to assist.  </p>
